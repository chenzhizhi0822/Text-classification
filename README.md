# Classification and analysis of textual data

## Objectives
- Master the method of data preprocessing and preprocess the training set data
- Master the method of text modeling to model documents in corpus
- Master the principle of classification algorithm and train text classifier based on supervised machine learning method
- Use the learned text classifier to classify and discriminate the unknown text
- Master the evaluation methods for evaluating the performance of classifiers

## Type of experiment
Design and programming implementation of data mining algorithm

## Requirements
- Number of text categories: 10
- Number of documents in training set: >=50000; An average of 5000 articles per category.
- Number of documents in test set: >=50000; An average of 5000 articles per category.
- Complete the experiment in groups, the number of team members is less than =3, and individual realization can get experimental bonus points.

## Contents
Using classification algorithm to realize text data mining, mainly includes:

- Corpus construction, mainly including using crawlers to collect Web documents, etc.;
- Data preprocessing of corpus, including document modeling, such as denoising, word segmentation, data dictionary establishment, document expression using bag of words model or topic model, etc.
Note: The use of thematic models, such as LDA, can obtain experimental bonus points;
- Select the classification algorithm (naive Bayes /SVM/ others, etc.), train the text classifier, and understand the modeling principle, implementation process and the meaning of related parameters of the selected classification algorithm;
- Classify the text of the test set
- Analyze and evaluate the classification results of the test set by using the correct rate and recall rate: calculate the correct rate and recall rate of each class, calculate the overall correct rate and recall rate, and calculate the F-score.
